# 📘 E-commerce ETL & Analytics Pipeline
A complete end-to-end pipeline to extract, clean, transform, analyze, and model e-commerce data using Python. Includes a full ETL workflow, exploratory analysis, visual insights, SQLite storage, and a delivery-delay prediction model.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a real-world style data engineering workflow on multi-table e-commerce data.  
The pipeline performs extraction, cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, analytics, and machine learning, producing ready-to-use insights and datasets.
